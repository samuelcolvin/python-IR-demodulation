python-IR-demodulation
======================

set of python scripts to demodulate signals from an infrared receiver

Works with an infrared reciever like [this](http://www.networkedmediatank.com/showthread.php?tid=29013).

Requirements: pyaudio, matplotlib, scipy, numpy, pickle and some other pretty standard python modules.

Currently running on Windows 7 and not tested on any other platform (but you might be lucky).
